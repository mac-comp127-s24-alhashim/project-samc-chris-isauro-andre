<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
MacF1 is a racing sim that allows the user to customize a car to drive around a huge map. The simulation is made to try implementing basic car physics in Java
using physics formulas that are translated into calculations in the simulation. 

#### Made With 
* Java 1.8.0_381-b09
* [Macalester kilt-graphics API](https://github.com/mac-comp127/kilt-graphics/tree/main/src/edu/macalester/graphics).
* Visual Studio Code
  
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
**To install:**
1. Download [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp).
2. Install Visual Studio Code and GitHub Desktop
3. In the main page, click the dropdown <> Code, in it, click Open with GitHub Desktop
4. In GitHub Desktop, clone the repository, then open it on Visual Studio Code
5. Run the program.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## How-To
**Demo Video:** [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1THGurXrps2vQ8SkUke7QnoA17MXivBud/view)

Once the program has started, a menu pops up, this is where you customize the car and choose the track

Click the start button to start the simulation and the car is spawned on the beginning of the track

To control the car use the "WASD" keys.
* "W" key to speed up
* "A" key to turn left
* "S" key to turn right
* "D" key to slow down and reverse

If the car is out of bounds, the car stops.

Happy Driving!

## Known Bugs
As of this version, the car must be speeding up to a certain amount to go in the correct direction after reversing.
The car might experience infinite turning speed as it slows down near 0 mph.
Depending on the device the software is run on, it might take some time for the track images in the simulation to load and may appear as missing images.
